# computational-neuroscience-project-dnc

Project for Computational Neuroscience Course - Differential Neural Computer usage for training simple algorithms.

Using NTM-Lasagna library - https://github.com/snipsco/ntm-lasagne

This project was able to show results of using NTM for copy and sort tasks, and showed that on simple data provided NTM learned to do sorting using "Pocket sorting algorithm", or very similar, according to external measures, such as memory consumtions and almost linear time to sort
